# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-bodden-jmb/">Joel Bodden</a>'s IT & Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

I'm passionate about cybersecurity, cloud computing, and hands-on defensive security work. My projects reflect real-world threat hunting, vulnerability management, cloud security, and SOC workflows—built through certifications, military experience, and ongoing professional development.

Feel free to explore the labs and see the work I’ve done to strengthen detection, response, and security operations!
